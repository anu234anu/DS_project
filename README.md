Together, we explored Polago Clothing's website, gathering key product info: names, prices, ratings, and reviews. Our data journey continued with simple charts showing how things were spread out. We used bar graphs and pie charts to highlight different product categories and their proportions.

Box plots helped us see where most data points fell and if any stood out as different. Correlation plots showed how things related to each other. The box plot, our final visual, summed up the data neatly, showing the main story of how things were spread out. Our teamwork not only improved our data skills but also uncovered fascinating insights within Polago Clothing's offerings, revealing a world of stories hidden in the numbers.
